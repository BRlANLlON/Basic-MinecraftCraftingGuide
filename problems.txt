Currently I am having problems with the forum in "CraftingGuide_v3";
	for some reason it allows you to login without creating an account nor the right
	cresidentials, and it also displays that you inputed the wrong information when 
	logging in with the incorrect information too.

I am also currently having problems with my imageviewers. 
	Imageviewer displays the image outside of the correct frame.
	(I am trying to get it displayed into frame3_image) 

	Imageviwer2 just doesn't display an image at all. 

	Note: Imageviewer and Imageviewer2 are basically the same code except the imaging 
	is a  little different.

	Also! Because of the imaging problems, I only have one image file inside both codes 
	so that it would be easier to figure out the problem.
